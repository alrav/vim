# Vim custom setup
Vim has been my primary IDE for a while now, and I have iterated my customizations with a primary specialization on PHP development. This can serve as a nice bootstrap for those also looking to use Vim as a PHP IDE.

# Installation
Run the install.sh script which will copy over the .vim and .vimrc configurations to your user root directory (e.g., ~). 
Existing .vim and .vimrc paths will be backed up under ~/.vimbak
